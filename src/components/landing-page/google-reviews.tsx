    text: "Let me start the review with a big - Thank you! for all the help to buy our DREAM HOME in Canada. It was quite challenging and had a lot of confusion initially when we started looking out: house/apartment, area, property builder, lawyer, budget, etc. (It's a long list!!), then a friend of mine recommended to meet Shivam. He was very informative, resourceful, and punctual in all the meetings. He understood our requirements well and shared his honest feedback & comments about each property. He made the entire process very smooth and also helped with the post-purchase things-to-do list as a friend. I recommend him to anyone who wants any help to buy a property.",

    text: "I had contacted Shivam for home purchase, and it was a wonderful experience. This was my first home purchase with little knowledge and experience of Canadian home market. The task was difficult for me, but it turned out to be easy with Shivam's help. Shivam was fully transparent from day one and was highly proactive to share all the updates. He was always available to help and talk even after office hours which was convenient and comfortable to me. I highly recommend Shivam for anyone who is looking to buy or sell a home.",
